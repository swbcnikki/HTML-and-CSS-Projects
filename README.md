# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
For my HTML and CSS projects at Tech Academy
Here is a display of sample websites I made using HTML and CSS

Projects
- The Space Station Resort.
      This site is for a company that specializes in space travel. This was 
      styled using CSS with images, navbar, image containers and contact form
- A Case for Community Gardens.
      This site is for an organization that is focused on promoting community 
      gardens and their benefits. The site is in the developing stages and so 
      far includes an embedded YouTube video, a form, images, article and list
- Academy Cinemas.
      This site was created using bootstrap. It includes navbar, columns, 
      images, pill buttons, forms and jumbotron banner.
- My Portfolio.
      This site was created using HTML and CSS. I will be adding more features 
      to this site as I continue through the bootcamp.
