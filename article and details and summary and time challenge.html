			<h2>Libraries</h2>
				<p>
				The library concept dates back millennia. The first systematically organized library<br>
				in the ancient Middle East was established in the 7th century BCE by Assyrian ruler<br> 
				Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, in contemporary Iraq. It contained approximately 30,000 cuneiform<br> 
				tablets assembled by topic. Many of the works were archival documents and scholarly texts,<br> 
				but there were also works of literature, including the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh.<br>

					<p>
					Almost every great civilization that followed built libraries, which were repositories<br>
					of knowledge often gleaned from far and wide. Some were so large and comprehensive that<br>
					their legend lives on today. The Library at Alexandria in Egypt, for example, is<br>
					believed to have held perhaps as many as 700,000 documents from Greece, Persia, Egypt,<br>
					India, and other regions. It was so large that it had a branch facility at the nearby<br>
					temple of Serapis. The world-famous Bayt al-Ḥikmah (House of Wisdom) in Baghdad,<br>
					established in 830 CE, was another “super library” famous for a huge collection, and<br>
					10th-century library of Caliph al-Ḥakam in Cordova, Spain, boasted more than<br>
					400,000 books. Rome and Athens also boasted expansive libraries, as did cultures in<br>
					other parts of the world, such as China and the Mayan and Aztec civilizations of<br>
					Central America.<br>
