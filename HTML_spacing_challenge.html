			<h1>A Strange World&#169;</h1><br>
			</section>
			A lot of people are like wheelbarrows - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">No good unless pushed.</span><br> 
			Some are like trailers - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">They have to be pulled</span><br> 
			Some are like canoes - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">They have to be paddled</span><br> 
			Some are like kites - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">If you don't keep a string on them, they will fly away</span><br> 
			Some are like footballs - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">You cannot tell which way they will bounce next</span><br> 
			Others are like balloons - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">Full of air and ready to blow up</span><br> 
			And yet, others are like neon lights - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">They keep going on and off</span><br> 
			But very few like a good watch - <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:oblique">Open faced- pure gold - quietly busy</span><br>
